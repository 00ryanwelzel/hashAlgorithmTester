hashAlgorithmTester:

Wrote a test script a bit ago to determine the clumping of hash algorithms. Custom user input files are used. 

  note:
  The first line of any input file must dictate the size of the hash table. (5 <= len <= 100)
  The lower stddev the better, as in this case it means the information is more evenly dispersed.
